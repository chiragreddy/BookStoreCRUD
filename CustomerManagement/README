How to run:

1. To run as a standalone spring boot application which has an embedded tomcat, run the command mvn spring-boot:run in the folder where pom.xml is located
2. To create a war and deploy it n tomcat server, follow below steps:
	a. run mvn clean install - This will create a war file inside target folder e.g. CustomerManagement-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war	
	b. Download Apache Tomcat in your local machine and copy this war file inside the webapps/ folder
	c. Go inside bin folder in your tomcat and run startup.sh file
	d. Now in your browser, navigate to  localhost:8080/CustomerManagement-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war/ to see if your application is up and running (This will now be the root path for all endpoints)
	e. Get all Customers - http://localhost:8080/CustomerManagement-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/getCustomer
